# Guess What Will Happen In This

Fabric mod where anyone can PR anything, concerning or not. I'll merge everything as soon as it works.

## How can I ~~fuck up~~ contribute to this project ?

You can do ANYTHING , adding blocks, items, whatever you want, mess with mixins, break vanilla mecanics, add dependencies, PR entire projects, as soon as it doesn't break other contributions and that it doesn't include any kind of virus, keylogger or backdoor. Game hacks are fine, system hacks are not. (thanks to @SekoiaTree for adding the rules about sys hacks)

## Current features (complete here in PR):

- Replace all sounds with "blyat" (thanks to @JFronny)
