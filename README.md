# Guess What Will Happen In This

Fabric mod where anyone can PR anything, concerning or not (no NSFW content). I'll merge everything as soon as it works.

## How can I ~~fuck up~~ contribute to this project ?

1) Create what you want : you can do ANYTHING , adding blocks, items, whatever you want, mess with mixins, break vanilla mecanics, add dependencies, PR entire projects, as soon as it doesn't break other contributions and that it doesn't include any kind of virus, keylogger or backdoor. Game hacks are fine, system hacks are not.
2) Make sure that it's designed to work on all systems. Ensure that you don't use Linux only features and so on. If you do something low level check that it will work on all systems. 
3) If possible, make it configurable. Not everyone wants to have a completly messed up rendering or a "concern" block that generates everywhere
4) If you've added a dependency, please add it in the "dependencies" section
5) Keep modifying the README as often as possible
